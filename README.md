# Project: Coffee Sales Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze and optimize sales strategies for a coffee company by focusing on loyal customers and identifying trends in customer behavior, product preferences, and geographical performance. The primary goal is to provide insights that maximize profit, especially through loyalty programs and targeted marketing strategies.

The analysis covers various aspects, including:
- **Customer and Order Trends:** Analysis by country and city to identify areas with the most and least customers, orders, and profits. The focus is on the U.S. cities for a deeper analysis.
- **Loyalty Program Optimization:** Identify areas and coffee types that should be targeted for a new voucher or discount program aimed at loyal customers.
- **Product Analysis:** Evaluation of the most and least ordered coffee types and roast types, with a focus on profitability across different regions.
- **Order Timing Patterns:** Investigating order patterns by time and location to determine the optimal periods for launching promotions.

## Raw Dataset:
The analysis is based on the coffee sales data available at Kaggle:
